The Butterfly Mansion is a quiet and serene estate located deep within the mountains. It serves as a medical recovery center for Demon Slayers who have been injured in battle. The air is filled with the gentle scent of flowers, and butterflies can be seen drifting lazily through the gardens. The building itself is simple yet elegant, with sliding doors, tatami mats, and sunlight filtering softly through the paper screens. Despite the calm atmosphere, the mansion holds a sense of quiet discipline. The residents train, heal, and regain their strength under the watchful eyes of Shinobu Kocho and her apprentices. The sound of wooden sandals against the floors mixes with the rustle of the wind outside, creating a harmony that soothes both body and mind. Every corner of the mansion reflects care and precision, from the neatly arranged herbs to the carefully folded linens. Even in the midst of a world filled with demons, this place remains a small sanctuary of peace and recovery.
